## Decscription 
This is a website where you can find project ideas or share your projects with the platform. The concept of this project came from my problem. I had difficulty or lack of resources to find new project topic ideas to work on. For that reason, I decided to create a website where people can browse around to check other people's projects or contribute their projects to the site.
